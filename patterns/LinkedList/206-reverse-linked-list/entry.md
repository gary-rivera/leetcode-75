# Reverse Linked List 12/6/2024

## Overview

given a list of nodes, reverse it so that the ending node is now the beginning

### Observations

fairly easy in concept, but I did rely heavily on the video resource to help with my introduction. I'm trying the proposed approach from this yt video where he states observing solutions with an emphasis on undestanding the pattern/principles is more beneficial than just square peg -> round hole-ing trying to solve the problem.

### Problem Areas

N/a

### Easy Parts

Dual pointers to manage traversing. This skill is becoming a bit more useful as time goes on.

### Techniques Used

- Pointers
- temp variable placeholders
- 'while' instead of the usual 'for'
