## A localized place to review and record any notes from comepleting the Leetcode 75, in preparation for future technicals.

### Intention
- logging thoughts on my solution as well as whether I note any improvements or pitfalls
- A checklist of how to solve these issues as well as refining my process for solving future problems
- tracking various resources that helped, including but not limited to:
   - videos
   - charts
   - infographics
   - gpt conversations
   - similar/consolidated problems
- a spreadsheet of each problem and what methods or patterns were utilized. hopefully this will help me isolate trends such as strong or weakpoints.
