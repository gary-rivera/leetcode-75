## A localized place to review and record any notes from comepleting the Leetcode 75, in preparation for future technicals.

### Intention

- logging thoughts on my solution as well as whether I note any improvements or pitfalls
- A checklist of how to solve these issues as well as refining my process for solving future problems
- tracking various resources that helped, including but not limited to:
  - videos
  - charts
  - infographics
  - gpt conversations
  - similar/consolidated problems
- a spreadsheet of each problem and what methods or patterns were utilized. hopefully this will help me isolate trends such as strong or weakpoints.

# Methodology

## Local Problem Solving

### Rules

- In order to improve critical thought, try to avoid console.log's
-

### Process

_Journal Entry_

1. create a journal entry for the problem. this should contain:
   - Overall summary of how solving the problem went
   - problem areas
   - easy parts
   - techniques used
   - overall time if possible
2. concepts learned
3. concepts reinforced
4. Which data pattern was used (if any)
5. tags section - different aspects of

_Solving_

- read the problem till expectation is understood.
- attempt for 30-45 mins (depending on overall progress)
- revisit problem areas and review resources to isolate blind spots

### Resources

- find a visual representation of the problem/ds/pattern

### Public Problem Solving

TBD
