## General Thoughts

Getting better. Whereas last week, I struggled greatly with just about any easy level problem, some of the general patterns are starting to finally stick out to me before even attempting.
Granted, I still find the whole leetcode skill redundant and unecessary, I'm at a point where I just have to accept the ridiculousness of this practice.

Still though, I'd much rather just actually code than to fill my gh commit history with these buffer commits.
